# Awesome-Beamer
The kinda awesome beamer theme!

## Using the theme
Just copy and paste `beamerthemeawesome.sty` into your project, add `\usetheme{awesome}` into your main file and your good to go :)

## Compilation
Using this theme requires you to run your compiler multiple times on your main LaTeX file. This is required for those litte dots in the footer to work.
If you're using latexmk you don't have to do this manually as latexmk can figure this stuff out by itself.
